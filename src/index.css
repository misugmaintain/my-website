body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

Do the same with `src/App.css` — either empty it or delete it entirely, since all styling is handled inline within the component.

**Step 6 — Add your photo.** Place your professional headshot in the `public/` folder (e.g., `public/headshot.jpg`). Then update the photo placeholder section in `App.jsx` to reference it with an `<img>` tag instead of the placeholder icon.

**Step 7 — Update your links.** Search the file for placeholder URLs (LinkedIn, Google Scholar, ResearchGate) and replace them with your actual profile addresses.

**Step 8 — Test locally.** Run `npm run dev` in your terminal. This starts a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. Open that in your browser to review everything before deploying.

## Phase 2: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel offers free hosting for personal sites, automatic HTTPS, and excellent performance. Here is how to get your site live.

**Step 9 — Create a GitHub repository.** If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com). Then create a new repository (e.g., `my-website`), and push your local project to it:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/misugmaintain/my-website.git
git push -u origin main
